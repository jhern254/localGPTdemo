human: Explain the data flow in a hospital system and the related complexities.
assistant: In a hospital system, various types of data are collected throughout a patient's stay. From the onset, details like registration and admit source are recorded. As the patient progresses through the hospital's care, data pertaining to diagnosis, procedures performed, recovery, and ultimately discharge is collected. Even while the patient is in-house, charges may accumulate. 
When a patient passes away, there is an "expired" discharge disposition which can influence the hospital's mortality rate. Regarding data storage, "Clarity" and "Enterprise Data Warehouse" are commonly used hospital databases. While the ADT (Admit, Discharge, Transfer) data is captured in the midnight census within Clarity with all data in one table, the Enterprise Data Warehouse often divides the data across two tables.
Patient class can also undergo changes throughout the stay. It's notable that some charges, like room charges, can post after a patient's stay, especially those posted after midnight. Additionally, there are more intricate charges that may require manual review before finalization.
On the billing front, the hospital system divides it into hospital billing and claims, while professional billing is tied to the medical network. A patient might have a hospital visit without incurring professional billing. However, professional billing is essential as it's dependent on the service provider, and a single patient's stay can have multiple professional billings.

human: Provide an overview of the hospital billing data infrastructure and its important elements.
assistant: The hospital uses a front-end application named "Epic" for viewing medical information. This application downstreams to "Clarity," which subsequently flows into the enterprise data warehouse. Notably, Clarity updates with the data of the previous day at midnight and serves as a buffer to ensure the system isn't overwhelmed, as it's derived from "Chronicle" - the real-time production data. However, while Clarity offers a snapshot, the enterprise data warehouse houses more comprehensive data, such as cost specifics.
Access to modules in the Epic can vary; for instance, while the app team has broad access, the Data Quality Governance doesn't. For troubleshooting, temporary access might be required to view different front-end templates or workflows. An interesting fact is that the enterprise data warehouse is refreshed twice daily: morning and evening. Billing tables, crucial for financial processes, get refreshed in the morning, while order-related and immunization tables are updated in the evening.
In the data hierarchy, one patient, denoted by an MRN (Medical Record Number), can have multiple HARs (Hospital Account Records). Each HAR, which is essentially a billing account, possesses one primary CSN (hospital encounter) but a HAR can have multiple CSNs. For every unique location or service, there's a unique CSN tied to it.
Finally, PFS (Patient Financial Services) interfaces majorly with HARs when dealing with payer information and state requisitions. Depending on the report's audience, whether it's the medical staff or executives, the data is pulled and presented either at the CSN, HAR, or other relevant levels. Hence, understanding the audience is key to extract and communicate the right data details.

human: Briefly explain the hospital's patient classification system and its data implications.
assistant: Patients are categorized by "Major" and "Minor" types at discharge, using the latest data. "Inpatient" is a major type but can further be specified as "newborn" or "hospice" in minor types. Emergency Department patients remain classified as such even if released. Other minor types include "Observation," "employee health" (no billing/csn), and "diagnostic." Patient class is indicated by HARs, more reliable than CSN. "Pat_enc_hsp" includes billing, but "pat_enc" captures all CSN. Notably, outpatients aren't always in this table, but for financial matters, they're treated as hospital visits. "Clarity adt" misses the major class; certain requests might exclude types like hospice. Actions without billing lack an HAR. The enterprise data warehouse uses a "non-valid" flag for outdated entries, pulling current valid data by mapping keys. Correctly discerning between inpatient, outpatient, or emergency types, as in the case of COVID, is essential.

human: Can you summarize the Epic's functionality and data practices?
assistant: The "Epic" offers an account lookup using the patient's MRN and account's HAR. Users can filter account types, excluding data like professional billing if it's excessive. The "Storyboard" on the left displays billing status, patient class, payer data, insurance, and family information. The "Events summary" tab provides census data, patient location, and movement details. Typically, patients either go from the Emergency Department to inpatient admissions or directly start at inpatient admissions. ADT represents admission, discharge, and transfer events.
Patient class can change during a stay under the same CSN. The app displays MDRH data, and its MRN system is unique. There are two MRNs for MDRH patients; the app advises against using PAT_MRN_ID. When MDRH migrated to the "Epic", they retained their MRN system. Hence, patients visiting both could have two MRNs: an enterprise MRN and a local one. The enterprise MRN always includes "- CS" and "300 MRN" denotes MDRH.
Each hospital has its MRN. When integrated into the "Epic", these MRNs can differ. It's crucial for reports to use the CS enterprise MRN to avoid data inconsistencies, as overlapping old MDRH MRNs can create issues. One instance was a mistake in a COVID report for immunocompromised patients. The CS does not prefix its MRN. Trauma patient records are merged into one MRN when identified, with the merge executed by the registration team. There's also a history table indicating merged MRNs.

human: How is patient data managed for HH and how can we identify their location using the system?
assistant: HH does not have its unique MRN but uses the same as the enterprise CS MRN since it was CS's first large acquisition. To determine if a patient's location is at HH based on their MRN, you don't rely solely on the MRN. Instead, check if there's activity in HH using the revenue location (rev_loc_id). This location identifier has various types. For report differentiation, CS and other hospitals are kept separate. The quickest way to filter out just CS in queries is an exclusion, specifically using not = 10118 in the WHERE clause. Within HSP_ACCT, data can pertain to either hospital billing or professional billing.

human: Can you provide an overview of what's inside the coding tab? assistant: The coding tab in the system is a comprehensive data input and verification tool. It includes the patient's discharge data with details on discharge dates and times. Inpatient time is derived from the ADT, which marks transitions in ADT types. The age data section is insightful. Although Epic calculates age, the enterprise data warehouse provides the age at admission. A default age of Jan 1, 1850, is used when the age is unknown. Trauma patients might sometimes not have age data, and a NULL age assumes adulthood, while 0 indicates a newborn. The tab also provides demographic data based on patient ID, including optional race data. Diagnostic and procedure data are validated at the HAR level and by HID, primarily for RV submissions. There's a section for the point of origin and discharge data, and the "EXPIRE" code is used to denote death. Data validation is of utmost importance in this tab, as coders finalize the information and send it to HID for further checks. Following this, the billing process starts. The inpatient class encompasses all entries except for hospice data.

human: Can you summarize the details on patient diagnosis coding and the nuances between ICD versions?
assistant: 
Patients can appear in multiple hospital systems and are identifiable via the enterprise MRN. In the "coding tab," diagnoses are ranked, with 1 indicating the principal diagnosis. While an admission diagnosis is noted, most reports utilize the final diagnosis. The universal coding system used is ICD-10, adopted by all hospitals for billing purposes. This replaced the ICD-9 in October 2015, marking a significant change in healthcare coding. ICD-10 is detailed, denoting specific locations, while ICD-9 was more generic. When analyzing data, it's vital to note the discharge date: if it's before October 2015, ICD-9 codes were used.
POA (Present on Admission) codes identify if a condition was present when a patient was admitted. These can indicate community-acquired conditions or those acquired in the hospital. "E" stands for exempt in the POA.
It's essential to recognize the logical_del_rec_flag in the enterprise data warehouse. While records aren't deleted, coders can mark them using this flag; for accuracy, filter out records flagged as 'N'.
External causes of injury codes provide context, like if an injury was intentional or accidental. For CS MRN, a 990 prefix indicates trauma patients. The system might merge these records into the primary MRN if a previous account exists.
Remember, when analyzing patient data, always refer to the most up-to-date MRN.

human: Describe the main points from the Procedures tab and medical billing details.
assistant: The Procedures tab features formats like ICD and CPT. ICD can show split records for surgeries. It includes details on the performing surgeon, while assistant providers are visible only to HID. The backend database highlights procedure ranks, with 1 being primary, and notes procedure start dates. After procedures, 3M groupers used by Epic categorize procedures and diagnoses. Billing is influenced by DRG, particularly MS-DRG for Medicare and commercial purposes, applied to inpatients. Groupers determine reimbursement, with weights indicating treatment complexity. For instance, a heart transplant has a higher weight than a normal newborn. Patient classification affects these weights, especially if complications are present. MS-DRG versions update annually in October. APR-DRG, different in weights and length of stay averages, is for Medicaid. MDC, a broader category enveloping MS-DRGs, is vital for financial contexts.

human: Can you provide a summarized overview of hospital coding, procedures, and the role of enterprise data warehouses?
assistant: Hospital coding can involve several ICD procedures and surgeries, which are ranked. Within coding, there are procedures where only the primary line indicates an assistant surgeon. The enterprise data warehouse contains this detailed information. In the Groupers tab, 3M is used to categorize procedures. MS-DRG is predominant for Medicare, while APR-DRG undergoes sporadic changes; for instance, California last updated in July after 2008. Notably, special codes like the U code for Covid were added for billing purposes in unique situations. The enterprise data warehouse also indicates primary codes and MS-DRG versions. While Groupers apply only to inpatients, the procedure UI may show minor patient types. Both inpatient coding and observation (outpatient) utilize ICD-10 codes.

human: Can you explain outpatient coding, its significance, and how efficiency is measured in hospitals using CMI?
assistant: Outpatient coding primarily uses CPT and HCPCS codes found under the coding tab. Unlike inpatient codes, these aren't ranked. An essential metric in hospitals is the CMI (Case Mix Index), which is the sum of MS-DRG divided by the number of discharged patients. CMI provides insight into the average severity and resource needs of the hospital's patient population. A higher CMI might indicate that the hospital's patients are sicker, on average. This metric is also linked to the length of stay, where procedures like heart transplants naturally have longer durations than, say, a newborn's stay. The goal is to decrease the length of stay, especially since Medicare reimbursement remains constant regardless of the duration. If a hospital's CMI remains consistent over the years but has a longer average length of stay compared to other facilities, it indicates inefficiencies. Consequently, hospital executives might be pushed to adopt new strategies to enhance performance.

human: Can you explain the nuances of ADT info, particularly regarding the length of stay, and how coding procedures differ from diagnoses?
assistant: ADT, or Admission-Discharge-Transfer information, plays a crucial role in hospital data systems. The length of stay, often related to inpatients but sometimes to observation cases, is recorded as a whole number, representing days and not specific times. For instance, if a patient is admitted and discharged on the same day, the length of stay is noted as 1 day, not 0. This is a common area where mistakes occur, as the intuitive response might be to record it as 0 days. The coding process by HID (Health Information Department) often excludes hospice cases, especially in situations like Cedars' in-house hospice, which doesn't use standardized codes. Additionally, while HID does code for inpatients, the Emergency Department, and observation cases, it doesn't handle all outpatient scenarios. Only selected groups get coded, and the HID team knows these specifics. Notably, procedure codes differ from diagnoses codes. Procedures detail the treatments or interventions given, whereas diagnoses codes identify the specific conditions or diseases present in a patient.

human: Could you shed some light on the differences between inpatient and outpatient coding processes, particularly with regard to charges, billing, and procedure codes?
assistant: Certainly. Both ED (Emergency Department) and observation cases are classified as outpatient. When the situation is straightforward, manual coding from charts might not be necessary. For example, in the outpatient diagnostic tab, we find the final diagnosis under the Hospital transaction inquiry.
All hospital-related expenses are categorized under hospital charges, while provider-related expenses fall under professional billing. Professionals, such as doctors, provide services and thus have separate billing. They often use RVUs and are acquainted with the CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) on the professional billing side.
Charges include actual costs, payments received, and any adjustments made. The revenue code, usually seen under procedure, displays itemized charges. However, in clarity, everything might be termed as a 'procedure,' but the actual data might be a Procedure code (often called an EAP code). The first four digits of the EAP code can be dictated by the payer.
For simpler procedures, like a mammogram, once nurses complete the procedure, charges are often automatically mapped. Some services might need manual coding, but for more straightforward ones, the Epic system can auto-generate codes. For outpatient services, excluding observations, HID manually codes CPTs during outpatient visits and on certain HARs (Hospital Account Records).
Some hospitals may lack specific Epic modules, leading to automated backend coding for straightforward procedures. While this "simple coding" can be beneficial, there's occasionally code duplication. Therefore, a human review is essential to ensure accuracy.
Lastly, in Clarity, the term "procedure code" can represent either a revenue code or an actual procedure code. This consolidation into one column might seem confusing, but those in finance usually interpret it as the revenue code.

human: Can you explain how the CPT and HCPCS billing works, especially in outpatient scenarios, and how one can prevent duplicate coding?
assistant: Absolutely. CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) and HCPCS (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System) are the foundations for outpatient billing. The CPT codes are maintained by the American Medical Association (AMA). In outpatient settings, billing typically uses CPT codes rather than ICD codes.
For straightforward procedures, automated systems can assign the relevant CPT codes, allowing coders to bypass manual entry. This is often referred to as "auto CPT". For example, in cases where a code with a modifier is used, charges are automatically applied, creating what's known as "auto charges" or "auto EAP codes".
However, for more intricate scenarios, HID is involved, especially in hospital billing for outpatient services, which could include diagnostics and observations. Yet, they typically won't handle imaging.
To prevent duplicate coding, which is a valid concern given the automated nature of certain processes, a union operation can be employed. By uniting all data sources for submission, you ensure that only unique entries are retrieved, preventing duplicates.
To simplify:
Level 1 pertains to CPT codes: They consist of 5 numeric digits, with the last character being alphanumeric. These denote actions or what the provider did.
Level 2 involves HCPCS codes, mainly for drugs and supplies: The format is 5 characters followed by 4 numbers. They indicate what the provider utilized during treatment.
ICD-10 codes come into play for diagnosis: They elucidate the reasons behind the provider's actions and choices, denoting why the provider did and used specific procedures or treatments.
In the context of outpatient billing, the primary code system is CPT.

human: Can you clarify the distinctions between ICD and CPT in terms of ranking and their application in various care settings? assistant: Of course. ICD and CPT are two distinct coding systems serving different healthcare documentation needs. ICD, or the International Classification of Diseases, is primarily employed for diagnosing diseases and is used for inpatient procedures. In inpatient care, ICD codes are assigned ranks, which signify the priority or gravity of the diagnosis or procedure. Typically, the "final diagnosis" is given a prominent rank, and for ICD procedures, a rank of 1 denotes the main procedure performed. On the other hand, CPT, or Current Procedural Terminology, is predominantly used for outpatient procedures. Unlike ICD, CPT codes lack a ranking system. In outpatient settings, the need for hierarchical prioritization is less pressing. Rather than relying on ranks, details like information on the assistant surgeon are provided adjacent to the CPT code, offering context. In summary, ICD codes use ranks to specify priority in inpatient treatments, while CPT codes, without ranks, offer clarity through placement and additional information in outpatient care.

human: Can you explain the Hospital Transaction Inquiry in relation to CPT codes and their sources?
assistant: The Hospital Transaction Inquiry system gathers CPT codes from both the Charges section and the Health Information Department (HID). For more intricate CPT procedures, the HID provides the data. To consolidate this information, data from Charges and HID is merged using a UNION operation, with a distinct column indicating the data source. Errors can sometimes be observed, notably from the enterprise data warehouse team. Patient Financial Services (PFS) occasionally input codes manually, with Level 1 representing CPT and Level 2 for drugs and supplies. While the front-end displays might seem mixed, the back-end distinctly separates these columns. Another column, alt_hcpcs_cd, provides alternate codes, often used when billing to Medicare. It's essential to be aware of these nuances when navigating the system.

human: Can you elucidate on how cost data and transaction details are managed in the hospital's system, especially concerning mammograms?
assistant: In the back end for procedures like mammograms, you'll find distinct fields. However, the "cost-amt" won't appear in Epic. This cost data is exclusively managed by the finance team and is stored only in the enterprise data warehouse and the finance system. The team working with Clarity doesn't handle this finance data; they mainly deal with operations. So, cost data isn't utilized within Epic or Clarity. Regarding transaction details, the "Transaction quantity" might indicate the number of nights a patient stays. There's also a "TransID", which is essentially a table identifier. In terms of coding, if a CPT is filled, the HCPCS might be left blank and vice versa. But in instances where an alternative code is displayed, both could potentially be filled, although CPT might remain blank if HCPCS is populated.

human: I'm trying to understand the intricacies of hospital billing, especially regarding charges, payments, and adjustments. Can you provide some clarity on this?
assistant: Certainly. In the hospital's system, while you can view all transactions, including charges, payments, and system adjustments, it's crucial to understand that the amount charged isn't always what's received. There's a mechanism called a contractual adjustment that plays a role. This adjustment arises from negotiations between managed care and the hospital. Their contract, based on various factors like service type, location, and physician, dictates the reimbursement amounts. Once agreed, this logic is passed to the Patient Financial Services (PFS) team, who then works with the application team to input it into Epic. This system calculates billable amounts and identifies what won't be billed, which appears as negative adjustments. For instance, Medicare may not pay as much as commercial insurances, leading to higher contractual adjustments for the latter.
Contracts usually last several years, with some specifically for discharges spanning three years. Payment is what the hospital receives after all adjustments. If there's a higher proportion of patients under Medicare, the hospital may earn less compared to commercial payers.
In situations where a patient revisits, say the Emergency Department, within a short span, instead of sending two separate bills, PFS merges the two accounts into one, termed a combined account, which is then billed. For clarity on specific transactions or account activity, you'd need to dig deeper into the system, filtering and grouping by relevant parameters. It's vital to ensure the accuracy of these records as they affect financial forecasts and decision-making.
Finally, while charges are billed at the account level, individual charges aren't tied to a specific payer. One account could have charges from multiple payers, complicating the billing process. The key is to understand that there are layers to this process, and navigating them requires attention to detail and understanding of the underlying system.

human: I need clarity on the lag time and handling of finance data, especially costs, within a hospital's system. Can you help?
assistant: Absolutely. Finance data within hospitals often experience a lag, particularly when it comes to cost amounts. Every data refresh can adjust the finance data going back to the start of the fiscal year (FY). This means that every monthly data refresh will update all data starting from the beginning of that fiscal year. Typically, there's a lag of about a month and a half. For instance, during the first three months of the fiscal year, you might not see any data. By October, the data for the beginning of the fiscal year becomes visible due to the refresh cycle. This allows users to view average costs associated with each EAP code.
However, it's vital to note that this Cost Amount data is not stored in the Clarity system. Instead, it resides in the enterprise data warehouse. Due to the inherent lag and complexities in understanding cost data, it's advisable not to provide this data to just anyone. The interpretation of this data requires specialized knowledge. If someone seeks cost data, they should be directed to consult with the finance team to ensure they comprehend its implications.
Furthermore, teams like Clarity often interact with various departments and external stakeholders. When data requirements arise, the Clarity team must validate the relevance and accuracy of the data before providing it. For example, when there was a need for vaccine status data, the team had to validate the information since using outdated or incorrectly interpreted data can lead to inaccuracies, such as mistaking a third vaccine dose as a booster. It's always crucial to cross-check and validate data to ensure it meets the specific needs of the requester.

human: Can you explain the process and implications of transitioning a patient to hospice care within a hospital's data system?
assistant: Certainly. When a patient's care transitions from acute to hospice within a hospital, it involves a distinct change in the hospital's data system. The initiation of hospice care leads to the creation of a new account, distinct from the acute care account. This is signaled by a '20' disposition code. So, while the initial record is from the acute care episode, a subsequent record is generated for the hospice care.
In many cases, the data related to hospice may appear blank, especially when it comes to coding. This is because hospice coding is typically handled externally. For instance, 'Seasons', a contractor, manages coding for some hospitals. When it comes to coverage, the setup might show 'hospice season' as the coverage plan. This isn't an actual insurance plan but rather an internal representation. In reality, the hospice service, like 'Seasons', will bill Medicare or the appropriate insurance provider.
The patient's guarantor doesn't typically change due to the transition to hospice care. However, when they move to hospice care, the guarantor might be displayed as 'hospice seasons'. To identify hospice accounts within the system, one can use the 'minor patient class'.
It's important to note that even though there's a transition from an ADT (Admission, Discharge, Transfer) to hospice, it's all under one account. However, the nature of care changes significantly from acute to hospice, which necessitates the creation of a new account or HAR (Hospital Account Record). Most hospice patients, unfortunately, do not recover and pass away. To ensure accurate internal reporting and not skew mortality rates, many hospitals separate these accounts. However, when reporting to the state or other external bodies, the reporting team often combines these accounts to provide an accurate fatality rate.

human: Can you provide a brief overview of how the hospital's data system manages organ donor patients after their passing?
assistant: Yes. When a patient who is an organ donor passes away in a hospital, the data system handles it in a particular way to ensure the appropriate recording of both the patient's death and the organ procurement. After the death, the patient's account will have a discharge disposition of '110', indicating organ procurement. Even though the patient has passed away in this first account, a second account is created specifically for the organ harvesting procedure.
Both of these accounts will be for inpatient care, with the first account classifying the patient under acute care with an organ procedure code, and the second account focusing on the organ procurement procedure itself, ending with a discharge disposition that indicates the patient has expired. The discharge date and time recorded in the data system will reflect when the patient died in the first record, not the second.
Within the ADT (Admission, Discharge, Transfer) system, the status of the patient as expired can be seen. As for the financial aspect, an organization named 'One Legacy' always covers the charges related to organ donation. This is because the patient obviously wouldn't bear the costs associated with their own organ donation. While the organ recipient also contributes to the payment, the exact process is complex and might vary. Typically, One Legacy is charged first for organ requisition costs, followed by transplant-related expenses.
For clarity and accuracy in managing these records, one shouldn't use the front end but rather search by MRN on the backend of the system and sort by the discharge date. Sorting in this manner ensures that the acute care episode always appears before the organ procurement. Important to note is that once a discharge disposition of '20' (indicating death) is assigned, no new accounts can be created under that disposition. The patient's specific details and type of account can often be gleaned from procedure documents visible on the frontend.

human: How does the hospital's data system determine the principal surgeon or attending physician for medical and surgical cases?
assistant: In the hospital's data system, the process to identify the principal surgeon or attending physician varies based on the nature of the case: medicine or surgery. For medical cases, the system primarily looks at the discharge summary. The HID (Hospital Information Department) checks if the discharge summary is available within 5 business days from the date of discharge. If it's available, the attending physician is identified based on who wrote the discharge summary. However, if the discharge summary is not available at the time of coding, then a definitive attending physician might not yet be identified.
On the other hand, for surgical cases, the system identifies the principal surgeon based on who performed the primary surgical procedure. Therefore, any performing provider that executed the main procedure is labeled as the "Principal Surgeon" within the enterprise data warehouse. The role attributed by HID for this provider is specifically 'Principal Surgeon'. Essentially, the performing provider of the primary procedure is automatically designated as the Primary Surgeon in the system.

human: Can you explain how the Epic system handles accounts, especially when the discharge disposition is 20 (expired) or in cases of recurring accounts such as oncology?
assistant: In the Epic system, when a patient's discharge disposition is coded as 20, indicating the patient has expired, the system doesn't allow the creation of new accounts for that patient. This ensures data accuracy and prevents potential inconsistencies.
For recurring accounts, often seen in situations like oncology where patients might have multiple scheduled visits over a period, there can be overlaps. For instance, if a patient has appointments pre-scheduled throughout a month and unfortunately passes away, the account remains open. If this goes on for, let's say 30 days, the discharge date might be set at the end of that duration, such as December 1. However, there's ambiguity in how to handle such cases. If a discharge disposition is marked as 'home', it's purely a decision made by the coder and might not always reflect the actual scenario.
Moreover, these recurring accounts are expected to overlap due to the nature of treatments like oncology. However, there are scenarios where overlaps are not logical, such as an inpatient having an overlapping diagnostic outpatient visit. This indicates that the patient, who is supposedly admitted, is also having an outpatient visit, which isn't feasible. Generally, only certain service units would trigger a new CSN (Care Sequence Number), whereas ADT (Admission, Discharge, Transfer) events don't lead to a new CSN being generated.

human: How does the Epic system handle MS-DRGs and under what scenarios might we not see an MS-DRG?
assistant: In the Epic system, MS-DRG (Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group) is assigned at the account or HAR (Hospital Account Record) level. Essentially, for one main billing account, there's an expectation to see only one MS-DRG. This is because the coding tab is set at the account level, and the MS-DRG assignment is done by HID (Health Information Department) specifically at the HAR level. Individual procedures, on the other hand, do not carry an MS-DRG designation. Another DRG type, the APR-DRG, is determined based on the admit date.
However, there are certain edge case scenarios where one might not observe an MS-DRG. These include:
A postponed surgery or procedure.
Hospice cases, where the primary focus is palliative care rather than treatment.
Instances where the Patient Class is updated to inpatient (IP) status only after the discharge, and the HID hasn't coded them yet. This can occur when case management reviews a visit and determines that it qualifies as an inpatient case, warranting an upgrade in status.

human: How does the Epic system report census data, and what are the expectations regarding admissions, discharges, and census events?
assistant: In the Epic system, for census reporting, the standard expectation is to observe one admission and one discharge per encounter. Furthermore, there should be one census event recorded at midnight for each day of an encounter. While there are 6 AM/PM census reports, the most common reference for the term "census" in the industry is the midnight census. However, users might also be interested in midday census data, leading to the generation of various reports at different times. When discussing census, the standard is to consider inpatients (IP). However, operationally, the patient class (pt_class) isn't always the primary focus. As long as a patient is in a bedded or nurse unit, it can include outpatient (OP) or observation (Obs) statuses to provide a more comprehensive view and avoid any potential confusion.

human: Can you explain how consulting providers are determined in the enterprise data warehouse and the roles HID attributes?
assistant: In the enterprise data warehouse, a script is utilized to review orders and notes to assign a consulting provider. HID doesn't typically code the consulting provider. While consulting can assist in provider reappointment, it's not always a sought-after feature by those on the floor. Nowadays, providers can place notes electronically, eliminating the need for a dedicated team to manually check charts. Instead, orders or notes can be scanned electronically to discern relevant details. When it comes to attributing providers, if there are multiple attendings, consulting gets attributed afterward. Everything present on the coding tab is coded by HID, except for referring and possibly other elements. For a provider to be considered as a consultant, they must possess the appropriate privileges. The privilege lists are managed in MSOW. Consulting roles require specific privileges, roles, and sometimes even specialties. It's important to note that residents and fellows cannot be consultants. Instead, HID will abstract the supervising provider. The definition and criteria for consulting may vary depending on the institution, with CMSC having stricter guidelines. As the role of a consulting provider is programmatically determined in the warehouse, it's unexpected for a provider to have both an HID-attributed role and a consulting role. The script that assigns roles is triggered upon coding completion. The roles attributed by HID typically include attending, admitting, referring, principal surgeon, and assistant surgeon.

human: Can you summarize the details around nursery charges and associated hospital billing procedures?
assistant: Certainly. Nursery charges for a newborn are typically billed to the mother's account, especially in the first 30 days, because a baby doesn't have its own insurance immediately. However, if a baby is transferred to the NICU, those specific charges are separate from the mother's account. Financially, some institutions might not include nursery charges in certain metrics. In relation to provider data, hospitals have procedures to verify the National Provider Identifier (NPI) against official registries. If there are discrepancies, the hospital's security team can adjust or inactivate records in their system. The Length of Stay (LOS) metric, indicating the duration of a patient's hospital stay, is calculated at the Hospital Account Record (HAR) level.
